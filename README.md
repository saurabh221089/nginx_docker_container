This dockerfile is use to create a Docker container hosting a HTML5 website template on an Nginx server (lightest web server).
We are using Alpine Linux distro as base image because it is so lightweight and small in size (just 4 MB) which makes our docker container least resource consuming.

## Prerequisites

Docker should be installed.


## Format of DOCKERFILE

**ADD**: Copy files from a source on the host to the containerâ€™s own filesystem at the set destination.

**CMD**: Execute a specific command within the container.

**ENTRYPOINT**: Set a default application to be used every time a container is created with the image.

**ENV**: Set environment variables.

**EXPOSE**: Expose a specific port to enable networking between the container and the outside world.

**FROM**: Define the base image used to start the build process.

**MAINTAINER**: Define the full name and email address of the image creator.

**RUN**: Central executing directive for Dockerfiles.

**USER**: Set the UID (the username) that will run the container.

**VOLUME**: Enable access from the container to a directory on the host machine.

**WORKDIR**: Set the path where the command, defined with CMD, is to be executed.


## Creating the container

1. Run the below command in the same directory where the dockerfile resides.

```docker build -t nginx_alpine . ```

2. Check for the created image

```docker images```

3. Create a container from this image.

```docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx_container nginx_alpine```

4. Check for the running container.

```docker ps```
